# CS231n-2017-
Because so many people have focused on deep learning, the trendency for it should be on schdule. CS231n is a very interesting program to helping us get more familiar with it from MIT.
However after trying several version answers, it is really difficult for the beginner to finish the code especially green to Python , Numpy and Scipy.
As a result, I just do it myself and I am sure all the codes are valid in my environment without cheating.
If you have any question, just pull an issue.
